# Production Environment Variables for Render
# These are managed through Render dashboard, but here's what you need to set:

# Database
# DATABASE_URL will be auto-injected from the PostgreSQL database created by render.yaml

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-this
JWT_EXPIRATION=7d

# Application
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Rate Limiting
THROTTLE_TTL=60
THROTTLE_LIMIT=100

# Note: PORT will be automatically assigned by Render and injected as an environment variable
# Never commit actual secrets to version control - use Render's environment variable management
